# VAPI Phone Number Provisioning Solution

## Current Situation

✅ **You already have a phone number in VAPI:** `+15484880543` (active)

❌ **Issue:** VAPI requires a **specific phone number** when provisioning - it doesn't auto-select

## The Problem

When trying to provision with `number: null`, VAPI returns:
```
number must be a valid phone number in the E.164 format
```

## Solutions

### Option 1: Use Existing Number (For Testing)

For now, you can use the existing number `+15484880543` for testing. However, for production, each business needs their own number.

### Option 2: Search for Numbers First (Recommended)

VAPI likely requires:
1. **Search for available numbers** (via Telnyx API or VAPI search endpoint)
2. **Select a specific number** from the results
3. **Provision that specific number** to VAPI

### Option 3: Check VAPI Dashboard

1. Go to https://dashboard.vapi.ai
2. Navigate to "Phone Numbers"
3. See if there's a "Purchase" or "Add Number" button
4. Check if you can provision numbers from the dashboard
5. If so, note the process and we can automate it

## Next Steps

1. **Check VAPI API docs** for phone number search/purchase endpoints
2. **Or** integrate Telnyx phone number search directly
3. **Then** provision the selected number to VAPI

## For Now

Since you have an existing number, we could:
- Use it for testing the signup flow
- Or implement number search/selection first
- Then provision new numbers during signup
