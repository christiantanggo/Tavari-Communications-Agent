# Debug Signup Phone Purchase

## Server Restarted ✅

The server has been restarted (PID: 26012) with the updated code.

## What Should Work Now

1. **Automatic Phone Purchase:**
   - User enters business phone number (e.g., +1 555-123-4567)
   - System extracts area code (555)
   - Searches for available numbers with that area code
   - Purchases via Telnyx `/number_orders` endpoint
   - Provisions to VAPI

2. **Existing Number Option:**
   - User checks "I already have a Tavari number"
   - Enters their existing Telnyx number
   - System verifies and provisions to VAPI

## Testing Steps

1. **Go to signup page**
2. **Fill in the form:**
   - Business name
   - Public phone number (e.g., +1 555-123-4567)
   - Leave "I already have a Tavari number" **unchecked**
3. **Complete signup**

## What to Check

### If Signup Fails:

1. **Check browser console** (F12) for errors
2. **Check server logs** for error messages
3. **Verify environment variables:**
   ```bash
   # Should have:
   TELNYX_API_KEY=your_key
   VAPI_API_KEY=your_key
   VAPI_TELNYX_CREDENTIAL_ID=your_uuid
   ```

### Common Issues:

1. **"TELNYX_API_KEY not set"**
   - Add `TELNYX_API_KEY` to `.env` file
   - Restart server

2. **"No available phone numbers found"**
   - Try a different area code
   - Check Telnyx account has funds/permissions

3. **"Failed to purchase phone number"**
   - Check Telnyx API key is valid
   - Verify account has billing set up
   - Check server logs for detailed error

## Debug Commands

```bash
# Test phone purchase directly
npm run test:phone

# Check server is running
netstat -ano | findstr :5001

# View server logs
# (Check the terminal where npm start is running)
```

## Next Steps

If it still doesn't work:
1. Share the **exact error message** you see
2. Share **server logs** from the signup attempt
3. Share **browser console errors** (if any)
