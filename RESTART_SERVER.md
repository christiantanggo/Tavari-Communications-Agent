# Server Restart Required

## ⚠️ Important: Restart Your Server

The code has been updated to **auto-detect your Telnyx credential** from VAPI. However, you need to **restart your server** for the changes to take effect.

## How to Restart

### Option 1: Stop and Start Manually
1. Stop the current server (Ctrl+C in the terminal where it's running)
2. Start it again:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Option 2: If Server is Running in Background
1. Find the process:
   ```powershell
   Get-Process -Name node | Where-Object {$_.Path -like "*Tavari*"}
   ```
2. Stop it:
   ```powershell
   Stop-Process -Id <PID> -Force
   ```
3. Restart:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## What Changed

The `provisionPhoneNumber()` function now:
- ✅ Auto-detects your Telnyx credential from VAPI
- ✅ Uses it automatically if `VAPI_TELNYX_CREDENTIAL_ID` is not set
- ✅ Logs detailed information about credential detection
- ✅ Provides better error messages

## After Restart

Try signing up again. The phone number provisioning should work automatically now!

## Verify It's Working

Check the server logs when you try to sign up. You should see:
```
