# Phone Number Purchase - Now Working! ✅

## Summary

The automatic phone number purchase system is now fully functional! The system uses Telnyx's recommended `/number_orders` endpoint with a fallback to the direct `/phone_numbers` endpoint.

## How It Works

1. **User signs up** with their business phone number
2. **System extracts area code** from business phone number
3. **Searches for available numbers** matching that area code
4. **Purchases number automatically** via Telnyx `/number_orders` endpoint
5. **Provisions to VAPI** for AI call handling

## Test Results

✅ **Phone number purchase:** Working via `/number_orders` endpoint
✅ **Area code matching:** Extracts and matches area codes correctly
✅ **VAPI provisioning:** Successfully provisions purchased numbers
✅ **Existing number option:** Users can provide their own Telnyx number

## Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

```env
# VAPI Configuration
VAPI_API_KEY=your_vapi_private_key_here
VAPI_TELNYX_CREDENTIAL_ID=your_credential_uuid_here

# Telnyx Configuration (for automatic purchase)
TELNYX_API_KEY=your_telnyx_api_key_here
TELNYX_API_BASE_URL=https://api.telnyx.com/v2  # Optional, has default
```

### Getting Telnyx API Key

1. Go to https://portal.telnyx.com
2. Sign up or log in
3. Navigate to **Settings** → **API Keys**
4. Create a new API key or copy an existing one
5. Add to `.env` as `TELNYX_API_KEY`

**Note:** The Telnyx API key is different from the VAPI credential. You need:
- **Telnyx API Key** → For purchasing numbers directly from Telnyx
- **VAPI Credential** → For linking Telnyx to VAPI

## User Flow

### Option 1: Automatic Purchase (Default)

1. User enters business phone number during signup
2. System automatically:
   - Extracts area code (e.g., "415" from "+14155551234")
   - Searches for available numbers with that area code
   - Purchases the first available number
   - Provisions it to VAPI

### Option 2: Existing Number

1. User checks "I already have a Tavari (Telnyx) phone number"
2. User enters their existing Telnyx number
3. System verifies it exists in Telnyx account
4. Provisions it to VAPI (no purchase needed)

## Technical Details

### Purchase Method

The system tries two methods in order:

1. **`/number_orders` endpoint** (recommended by Telnyx)
   - Creates a number order
   - Returns order with phone numbers
   - More reliable for bulk purchases

2. **`/phone_numbers` endpoint** (fallback)
   - Direct purchase
   - Used if number_orders fails

### Area Code Matching

- Extracts 3-digit area code from business phone number
- Searches Telnyx for numbers with matching area code
- Falls back to any available number if no match found

### Error Handling

- Checks if number already exists before purchasing
- Handles both purchase methods gracefully
- Provides clear error messages if purchase fails

## Testing

Run the test script:

```bash
npm run test:phone
```

This will:
1. ✅ Check Telnyx credentials
2. ✅ Search for available numbers
3. ✅ Purchase a number via `/number_orders`
4. ✅ Provision to VAPI
5. ✅ Verify success

## Next Steps

- ✅ Automatic purchase working
- ✅ Area code matching working
- ✅ Existing number option working
- 🔄 Number porting (future feature)
- 🔄 Advanced area code selection (future feature)
